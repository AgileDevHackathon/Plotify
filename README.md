# Plotify
A data visualization platform where users can upload spreadsheets and csv files and it spits out pretty interactive shareable graphs for them.

Plotify is pretty much a front end for d3.js or chart.js. The user uploads data from a form/file upload and the backend parses the data and spits out the nice pretty graphs.

Users can signup/login, they then upload their .xls .csv or .json files and they can choose the different columns/fields that they want to chart, specific headers, rows etc... and the platform then charts it for them and saves it to their profile for later viewing and sharing.
